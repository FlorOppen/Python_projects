# Python Projects

This repository contains various Python projects and scripts that I have developed. It is organized into the following sections:

- **Machine_Learning**: Machine learning projects using common datasets from Kaggle.
- **Scripts**: Various scripts used for different daily tasks.
- **Statistics**: Statistical analyses performed with Python.

Each folder contains its own README.md with specific details about the projects and scripts contained within.
