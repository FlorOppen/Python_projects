# Analysis of the DiGeorge Syndrome Region in Chromosome 22

## Description

This project focuses on the analysis of genomic variants within the DiGeorge Syndrome region of chromosome 22. The analysis includes:

- Annotation of VCF files using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to enrich the data with functional annotations.
- Filtering of variants to focus on the specific region of interest.
- Performing various analyses to understand the potential impact of these variants.

## Objectives

- **Functional Annotation:** Enrich VCF data with additional information using VEP.
- **Variant Filtering:** Select and analyze specific variants within the DiGeorge Syndrome region.
- **Impact Analysis:** Assess the potential impact of the identified variants.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed (you may need to add more as required):

- [VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html)
- Other specific libraries that may not have been explicitly listed in the notebook.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Open and execute the cells in the order they are arranged.

## Data

This analysis uses VCF data containing genomic variants. The data focuses on the region of chromosome 22 associated with DiGeorge Syndrome. It is recommended to review the original data sources for more details.
